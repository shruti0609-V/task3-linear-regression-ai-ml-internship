# Linear Regression - Task 3

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship program.  
The objective is to implement and understand both simple and multiple linear regression models.

## Project Description
We use a housing price dataset to:
- Import and preprocess the data
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Plot the regression line
- Interpret the model coefficients

## Requirements
Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Libraries used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Open `task3_linear_regression.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run all the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
- Successfully implemented linear regression.
- Evaluated model performance with metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.
- Visualized the regression line and understood the model's interpretation.

## Dataset
The housing price prediction dataset from Kaggle was used:
